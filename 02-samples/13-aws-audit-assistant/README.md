## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Local Installation (Development Only)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This option is strictly for development and testing purposes only. DO NOT use this installation method in any production environment as it may not have the necessary security controls and could potentially impact your AWS resources. For production use, always use Option 2 (Sandbox Environment) which provides proper isolation and read-only permissions.

```bash
# Install dependencies using uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the assistant
uv run ai_assistant.py
```

### Option 2: Sandbox Environment (Recommended)

The sandbox environment provides a secure way to run the AWS Audit Assistant with appropriate read-only permissions. It includes Terraform configurations to create an EC2 instance with the necessary IAM roles and security settings.

#### 1. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Navigate to sandbox directory
cd sandbox

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the deployment plan
terraform plan

# Deploy the resources
terraform apply
```

- [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
- [EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

#### 2. Copy Required Files
After the infrastructure is deployed, copy the necessary files to the EC2 instance:

```bash
scp -i ./audit-assistant-key.pem \
    ../ai_assistant.py \
    ../aws_document_agent.py \
    ../strands_boto_agent.py \
    ../requirements.txt \
    ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>:/home/ec2-user/
```

- [EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)

#### 3. Install Dependencies
SSH into the EC2 instance and install the required packages:

```bash
# Connect to the instance
ssh -i ./audit-assistant-key.pem ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- [Python Package Installation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)

#### 4. Run the Assistant
```bash
python3 ai_assistant.py
```

#### Security Features
- EC2 instance is configured with read-only IAM role
- Security group limits inbound access
- All operations are performed with least-privilege permissions
- Terraform-managed infrastructure for consistency

- [Least Privilege Principle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)

#### Cleanup
When you're done using the sandbox environment, destroy the resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

The AWS Audit Assistant accepts natural language queries about your AWS resources. Here are some example commands:

```plaintext
> Check if my S3 bucket 'my-bucket' follows security best practices
> Audit EC2 instance 'i-1234567890abcdef0' in us-west-2 for security compliance
> Verify if my IAM policies follow the principle of least privilege
> Evaluate RDS database 'my-database' configuration against AWS recommendations
```

## 🔍 Features

- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Evaluates resources against AWS best practices
- **Natural Language Interface**: Simple English commands to perform complex audits
- **Safe Execution**: Read-only operations by default
- **Detailed Reports**: Clear findings and recommendations
- **Multi-Resource Support**: Covers S3, EC2, IAM, RDS, and more
- **Best Practice Updates**: Stays current with AWS recommendations

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. Always use the sandbox environment for production audits
2. Review generated scripts before execution
3. Use read-only IAM roles when possible
4. Monitor AWS CloudTrail for audit activities
5. Regularly update dependencies for security patches

## ❗ Troubleshooting

### EC2 Connection Issues
If you can't connect to the EC2 instance:
- Verify your security group allows SSH access from your IP
- Ensure you're using the correct key pair
- Check that the instance is running

- [Security Group Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html)

### Dependency Installation
If dependencies fail to install:
   - Verify Python version (3.11+ required)
- Check internet connectivity
- Ensure pip is up to date

- [Python Installation Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)
- [Pip Documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Assistant Runtime Issues
If the assistant fails to run:
- Verify all required files were copied correctly
- Check AWS credentials are properly configured
- Review EC2 instance role permissions

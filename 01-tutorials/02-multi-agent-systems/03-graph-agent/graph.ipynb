    "\n",
    "### 1. Nodes (Agents)\n",
    "Each node represents an AI agent with:\n",
    "- **Identity**: Unique identifier within the graph\n",
    "- **Role**: Specialized function or purpose\n",
    "- **System Prompt**: Instructions defining the agent's behavior\n",
    "- **Tools**: Capabilities available to the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Edges (Connections)\n",
    "Edges define communication pathways with:\n",
    "- **Direction**: One-way or bidirectional information flow\n",
    "- **Condition**: Optional function that determines if the edge should be traversed\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Define execution order and data flow between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. GraphBuilder\n",
    "The GraphBuilder provides a simple interface for constructing graphs:\n",
    "- **add_node()**: Add an agent or multi-agent system as a node\n",
    "- **add_edge()**: Create a dependency between nodes\n",
    "- **set_entry_point()**: Define starting nodes for execution\n",
    "- **build()**: Validate and create the Graph instance\n",

    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design for acyclicity:** Ensure your graph has no cycles</p>\n",
    "**Use meaningful node IDs:** Choose descriptive names for nodes</p>\n",
    "**Validate graph structure:** The builder will check for cycles and validate entry points</p>\n",
    "**Handle node failures:** Consider how failures in one node affect the overall workflow</p>\n",
    "**Use conditional edges:** For dynamic workflows based on intermediate results</p>\n",
    "**Consider parallelism:** Independent branches can execute concurrently</p>\n",
    "**Nest multi-agent patterns:** Use Swarms within Graphs for complex workflows</p>\n",
    "**Leverage multi-modal inputs:** Use ContentBlocks for rich inputs including images</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now mastered the fundamentals of building multi-agent systems with Strands Agent Graph! You can create sophisticated networks of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to successful multi-agent systems is:\n",
    "- Matching topology to use case\n",
    "- Defining clear agent roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Establishing proper communication patterns\n",
    "- Managing resources and cleanup effectively\n",
